# Movie-Recommender-Systems
 Movie recommender systems are applications that suggest movies to users based on their preferences, ratings, or viewing history. Unsupervised machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence that learns from unlabeled data without human supervision. Movie recommender systems can use unsupervised machine learning techniques to discover hidden patterns or clusters in the data, such as genres, themes, or user profiles. These techniques can help improve the accuracy and diversity of the recommendations, as well as reduce the cold start problem, which occurs when there is not enough data for a new user or item.
